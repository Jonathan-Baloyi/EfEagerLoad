# EfEagerLoad

EfEagerLoad allows you to add eager loading to your Entities automatically without minimal setup.

It includes mechanims to selectively control how your entities are will be eager loaded both by built-in Attributes as well as programatically.

Internal caching of the resulting Include Functions to execute for the Entities being used is built-in but only rudimentary at the moment (limitations).
